To the Metrowerks / CodeWarrior / PowerPlant community:=======================================================¥ The source code to two industrial-strength demo-apps which demonstrate  how to use all the important facets of the Drag and Drop manager using  PowerPlant in the Metrowerks CW environment.¥ They demonstrates dragging a graphic object around a view, between views,  or between an application and another Drag & Drop savvy application such  as the Finder (including the special circumstance of dragging to the  trash) or Scrapbook.¥ They have been blanket-bombed with instructional comments.¥ They show how to to handle operations on the front end (how the C++  object 'prepares itself' for dragging) and secondly, how the receiving  view handles in incoming object.The first 'mini' demo:======================¥ Shows how to do a minimal implementation of Drag and Drop using LDragTask.The second 'main' demo:=======================¥ Demonstrates how to subclass LDragTask so you can (a) add a PICT  flavor to the drag item for use in Finder clipping files and in the  scrapbook and (b) define a custom outline for the item being dragged.¥ It discusses in detail (and implements) all human interface stuff such  as when the object is copied and when it is merely moved, all the  appropriate visual feedback, etc.¥ It includes full cut-and-paste support, and demonstrates the similarities  in implementing Drag & Drop and Cut & Paste.Some stuff they doesn't do (yet?)=================================¥ Multiple-object selection / dragging¥ UndoComments/suggestions/whatever to:=================================Gilles DignardPelican Bay Software Inc.gdignard@hookup.net1306-270 Queens Quay WestToronto, ON(416) 260-0480Disclaimers / Distribution notes, etc.======================================This demonstration application is provided as is without any claim made bythe provider as to any suitability for any particular purpose.
